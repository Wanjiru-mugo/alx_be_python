#program calculates the sum, difference, and product of 2 variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5
sum = number1 + number2
difference = number1 - number2
product = number1 * number2

#now we print their results 
print("Addition of", number1, "and", number2, "is", sum)
print("Subtraction of", number1, "and", number2, "is", different)
print("Multiplication of", number1 "and", number2, "is", product)
